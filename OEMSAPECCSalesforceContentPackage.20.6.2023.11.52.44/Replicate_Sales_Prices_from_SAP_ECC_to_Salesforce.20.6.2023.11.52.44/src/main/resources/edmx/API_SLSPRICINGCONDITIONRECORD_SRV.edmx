In the standard version of the SAP System, this field is only relevant in condition records for the following discounts:Price groupPrice group/Material pricing groupYou apply a price group discount to customers in a particular foreign country. When you create a condition record for this discount and enter values in the pricing scale, you can also enter the corresponding foreign currency. During pricing, the system then calculates discounts based on scale values in the foreign currency.

A quantity in the alternative unit of measure can only be shown precisely if its value can be shown with the decimal places available. To ensure this, please note the following:The base unit of measure is the unit satisfying the highest necessary requirement for precision.The conversion of alternative units of measure to the base unit should result in simple decimal fractions (not, for example, 1/3 = 0.333...).Inventory ManagementIn Inventory Management, the base unit of measure is the same as the stockkeeping unit.ServicesServices have units of measure of their own, including the following:Service unitUnit of measure at the higher item level.

      <Summary>Groups together up to three key fields that the system uses to determine the appropriate tax rate in the case of dynamic exceptions. The key fields refer to information stored in the customer, vendor, and material master records (except for the tax code, which is taken from the item level in the transactions).</Summary>
      <LongDescription>Tax rates are maintained for each of the tax types IPI, ICMS, SubTrib, and ISS, as defined by these factors or combination of factors. In addition to these rates, dynamic exceptions allow you to define tax rates according to additional factors. To do so, you define tax groups, which contain up to three factors (key fields), and which you activate for the different tax types.To define a tax group, specify:A number for it in the range from 10 to 89Which key field(s) are to be used (up to three)Calling application used to calculate the taxWhich tax types the tax group is to be activated for (IPI, ICMS, SubTrib, and/or ISS)After you have defined tax groups, you enter tax rates applicable for a particular tax type and tax group combination.Several tax groups can be activated for a tax type. If this is the case, the system finds the relevant tax rate based on the following information:If you use condition-based tax calculation, you need to adjust the access sequences that belong to the conditions that store the rates whenever you create or change a tax group.If you do not use condition-based tax calculation, you do not have to maintain the corresponding access sequences. Instead, the system reads the entries in the list, starting at the top. The first entry that it finds data for is used to determine the tax rate. Assume, for example, that tax group 50 contains the key field NCM code and tax group 51 contains the key field material class. If, during tax calculation, the system finds a record for both tax groups, 50 and 51, it takes the lower number, 50.</LongDescription>

      <Summary>The rate that determines how the system calculates pricing using this condition. Depending on the condition type, the rate can be a fixed amount or a percentage. If the condition includes a pricing scale, the rate displays the first line of the scale.</Summary>
      <LongDescription>The following examples illustrate how you can use the rate in different condition types:If you create a condition that includes prices (for example, prices for a material), you enter an amount.If you are creating a condition based on percentage discounts or surcharges (for example, a customer-specific discount), you enter the value of a percentage.

      <LongDescription>You define the base unit of measure and also alternative units of measure and their conversion factors in the material master record.Since all data is updated in the base unit of measure, your entry is particularly important for the conversion of alternative units of measure. A quantity in the alternative unit of measure can only be shown precisely if its value can be shown with the decimal places available. To ensure this, please note the following:The base unit of measure is the unit satisfying the highest necessary requirement for precision.The conversion of alternative units of measure to the base unit should result in simple decimal fractions (not, for example, 1/3 = 0.333...).Inventory ManagementIn Inventory Management, the base unit of measure is the same as the stockkeeping unit.ServicesServices have units of measure of their own, including the following:Service unitUnit of measure at the higher item level.
